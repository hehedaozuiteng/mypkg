# mypkg

This R pageage is coding part of my stat 440 (Computational Inference)'s final project, and modified from the [generalized boosted models](https://github.com/gbm-developers/gbm). It specialized in an bernoulli distribution, and the database comeing from [Rain in Australia]( https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package)

This package has add two addition function, Quick Nodes Morph Mend and Weight boost.

Quick Nodes Morph Mend uses a gradually shrink learning rate to fit the model, and so increasing the accuracy and reduce the operation times. 

Weight boost gives a weight of each observation based on differenc method.
