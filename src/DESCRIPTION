Description: This package contains a training model Gradient Boosting Regression(GMB). GBM is a learning method that combines many decision trees as the weak predictors. into an ensemble, forming a strong predictor. In this package, we are focus on the Bernoulli distribution, and write a series of tools to improve its accuracy and reduce its running time. Otherwise, we are trying to use control weight of each observations to anti the unbalance dataset.
